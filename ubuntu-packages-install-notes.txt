mpettis@ubuntu:~$ pip install gunicorn
The program 'pip' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install python-pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Then
pip install gunicorn

Running:
With a hello app like so:
# http://gunicorn.org/

  $ cat myapp.py
    def app(environ, start_response):
        data = b"Hello, World!\n"
        start_response("200 OK", [
            ("Content-Type", "text/plain"),
            ("Content-Length", str(len(data)))
        ])
        return iter([data])

Need to set up port 8000 forwarding on the VM:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9537751/virtualbox-port-forward-from-guest-to-host

    Connect to the Guest and find out the ip address:

    ifconfig 
    example of result (ip address is 10.0.2.15):

    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:AE:36:99
              inet addr:10.0.2.15  Bcast:10.0.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
    Go to Vbox instance window -> Menu -> Network adapters:

    adapter should be NAT
    click on "port forwarding"
    insert new record (+ icon)
    for host ip enter 127.0.0.1, and for guest ip address you got from prev. step (in my case it is 10.0.2.15)
    in your case port is 8000 - put it on both, but you can change host port if you prefer
    Go to host system and try it in browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000
    or your network ip address (find out on the host machine by running: ipconfig).



Then start gunicorn in the folder with myapp.py as:
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app

Url to reach the service from local windows (host) machine):
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/
